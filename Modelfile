 Sbiba (Sufes) - A Comprehensive Overview
 Page 1: Introduction
 Sbiba, known in ancient times as Sufes, was a town of significant historical and archaeological
 value. It was located in the province of Byzacena, in what is now Tunisia. The town flourished during
 the Roman era and later became a notable Christian bishopric. Sufes offers valuable insight into the
 cultural dynamics between Roman paganism and early Christianity. The remnants of its structures,
 including basilicas, temples, and fortifications, provide a glimpse into the region's past.

 Sufes was part of the vast Roman empire, which spread across North Africa. The town thrived due
 to its strategic location and fertile surroundings. Its integration into the Roman province of Byzacena
 helped in connecting it with other prominent Roman towns. Sufes was known for its role as a trade
 hub, fostering the exchange of goods and ideas between different Roman territories.

 As the Roman Empire began to embrace Christianity, towns like Sufes transitioned from pagan
 temples to Christian places of worship. Sufes eventually became the seat of a Christian bishopric.
 This transition highlights the cultural and religious shift that took place in the Roman provinces
 during the later stages of the empire. The conversion of the population and the construction of
 churches and basilicas are key aspects of the town's historical evolution.

 military system.
